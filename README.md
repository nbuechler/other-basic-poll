Based on react-reduct tutorial. The link to the tutorial can be found here: http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html

# Lessons Learned:

* The internet is a great place to go for resources, and they usually are free - which can be better than paying for a class.
* When react was brand new, and then when redux was released, this tutorial helped me familiarize myself with those technologies and others. I was also introduced to webpack, and es6.
* I reaffirmed that I don't have to commit to completing a full project if I commit to a specific set of goals. Again, in this case, the goal was to try out a new tool, and to use it in a valuable way. I accomplished this goal because I was able to enhance my understanding.
* Also, I wanted to make some of the tools work well enough so that I could continue working on other software that I'm making, such as the microservices in the _Logro_.
